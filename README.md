## Overview of Project: Creating Dynamic Content
In this module, I have built a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. I created filters to make this table fully dynamic, it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.

I customize the webpage using Bootstrap, and equip the table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations. The users can learn/view about UFO sighting by filtering data by
- date
- city
- state
- country
- shape of the UFO
-
