## Overview of Project: Creating Dynamic Content
In this module, I have built a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. I created filters to make this table fully dynamic, it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.

I customize the webpage using Bootstrap, and equip the table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations. The users can learn/view about UFO sighting by filtering data by
- date
- city
- state
- country
- shape of the UFO


## Results: 
So onve loaded the user sees a page with interactive table and user can select date, city, country an shape of the UFO to narrow down the search and find out infor about the UFO sighting. So once of page user can add the date or city of interest to get specific results.

## Summary: 
### Drawback of this new design 
- Clear Filter: it is not clear how the user can clear the search and see the whole table. 

### Recommendations:
- Add a clear filters button to clear the filetrs and see the whole table.
- If the filter doesn't return any data, then it should dipslay  a messagae that "No UFO was seen on the given date in the given City."
